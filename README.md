This is a project I undertook to advance my skills using [React.ts](https://reactjs.org/) and other parts of its ecosystem. 

The App allows you to calculate the weekly wage, where the hourly rate is 10 euros and overtime is 20 euros. In the list you need to select a specific employee, as well as the desired week. Data processing imitates request from backend
